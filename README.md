# Spam-Detection
This project uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to classify messages as spam or not spam. Built using Python and Scikit-learn, it includes data preprocessing (tokenization, TF-IDF), model training (Naive Bayes, SVM), and evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision and recall.
